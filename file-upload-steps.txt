We are going to use file upload in image url for product.
To achieve this we are using 3rd party library: multr

1. Install multr
2. Update View (for specific image upload)
3. Middleware to handle files(saving the file on server in a separate folder and 
take that url and store in memory array)
4. Apply that Middleware
5. Update Controller to update urls of image.


https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer
Multer is a node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data(multipart form data means
using a HTML form we are able to send binary data such as files,images,PDFs and all), 
which is primarily used for uploading files.
 It is written on top of busboy for maximum efficiency.
